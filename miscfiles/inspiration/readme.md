I got the idea for this from https://github.com/CodySchrank/MTT which is included in this project as a sub module for reference.. 

I really liked how he created a MSBuild task which could be dropped into a csproj file via Nuget. 

I thought that I'd have a shot at creating a (more robust?) reflection based TypeScript generator as well

Type ```git submodule update --init``` after cloning main repo to pull down this repo.
